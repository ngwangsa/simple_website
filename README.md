# simple_website

@author Nathan Wangsa

I had started doing some web development a few years back, but got discouraged and bogged down with school/work.

The goal is to create a simple website for educational purposes. Might create a main page that links to the "projects" that are assigned from the tutorial I am following. Main page should have simple logo with a horizontal navigation bar across the top. The options will be "About", "Projects", "Resources". Projects should allow for a drop-down menu linking to each project as they are being made.
